        <img class="h2" src="F1-pictures/F1 TEAMS.jpg" alt="F1 Teams"/>
        <p>Formula One has 10 teams. Every team in Formula One must run two cars in every session in a Grand Prix weekend, and every team may use up to four drivers in a season. Teammates drive alongside to earn the highest score for the team but this sentence is not always right because sometimes drivers have very close scores and that's the reason that drivers push each other considering that they're in the same team. Sometimes this reason is causing the trouble for the teams and relationship between the teammates.</p>

        <li class="topics"><h2 class="safty-car-h2" id="safty-car-h2">SAFETY CAR</h2></li>
        <img class="h2" src="F1-pictures/safety-car.jpg" alt="SAFETY CAR"/>
        <p>The safety car is a critical component of Formula One racing, designed to ensure the safety of drivers and track personnel during incidents. Here’s an in-depth look at the role and procedures involving the safety car:</p>
        <p><b>1. Purpose of the Safety Car:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Neutralizing the Race:</b> The safety car is deployed to slow down the field and neutralize the race in case of an accident, debris on the track, or adverse weather conditions.</li>
            <li><b>Allowing Safe Recovery:</b> It provides a safe environment for marshals to clear the track and for medical teams to attend to any injured drivers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>2. Safety Car Deployment:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Decision to Deploy:</b> Race control decides to deploy the safety car, and yellow flags and SC boards are shown around the circuit.</li>
            <li><b>Joining the Track:</b> The safety car enters the track in front of the race leader, who must then slow down and follow it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>3. Procedures During Safety Car Period:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Slowing Down:</b> All cars must reduce their speed and form a single line behind the safety car.</li>
            <li><b>No Overtaking:</b> Overtaking is strictly prohibited unless a car is instructed to pass the safety car to un-lap itself.</li>
            <li><b>Pit Stops:</b> Drivers can still make pit stops, which can be strategically advantageous as the field is bunched up.</li>
            <li><b>Maintaining Tire Temperature:</b> Drivers weave from side to side to keep their tires warm and maintain optimal performance.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Race Resumption:</b> Once the track is clear, race control signals the safety car to return to the pits, usually after announcing that it will come in at the end of the current lap.</li>
            <li><b>Final Preparations:</b> The leading driver controls the pace and prepares for the restart, with the safety car lights turned off as it heads back to the pits.</li>
            <li><b>Green Flag:</b> The race resumes, and drivers can overtake again once they cross the start/finish line.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The safety car plays a vital role in maintaining safety during Formula One races, ensuring that incidents are managed effectively without compromising the well-being of drivers and officials.</p>

        <img class="h2" src="F1-pictures/tyres.jpg" alt="TYRES"/>
        <p>Tyres are one of the most critical components in Formula One, significantly affecting the car’s performance and strategy. Here’s a detailed look at F1 tyres:</p>
        <p><b>1. Types of Tyres:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Slick Tyres:</b> Used in dry conditions, they have no tread pattern and offer maximum grip. There are several compounds, ranging from hard (durable but less grip) to soft (more grip but less durable).</li>
            <li><b>Wet Tyres:</b> Designed for rainy conditions, they have grooves to channel water away and prevent aquaplaning. Intermediate tyres are used for light rain, while full wet tyres are for heavy rain.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>2. Tyre Compounds:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Hard:</b> Most durable, used for longer stints but provide less grip.</li>
            <li><b>Medium:</b> Balanced between durability and grip.</li>
            <li><b>Soft:</b> Offer maximum grip but wear out faster.</li>
            <li><b>Super Soft, Ultra Soft, Hyper Soft:</b> Even more grip and less durability, used for qualifying and short stints.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>3. Tyre Management:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Degradation:</b> Tyres wear out over time, affecting grip and performance. Managing degradation is crucial for race strategy.</li>
            <li><b>Temperature:</b> Tyres need to be in the optimal temperature range for best performance. Overheating or running too cold can reduce grip.</li>
            <li><b>Pressure:</b> Correct tyre pressure ensures even wear and optimal contact with the track.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>4. Pit Stops:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Teams change tyres during pit stops, balancing the need for fresh tyres with the time lost in the pits.</li>
            <li>Strategic pit stops can give teams a competitive advantage, especially in changing weather conditions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>5. Tyre Regulations:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The FIA sets rules on how many sets of tyres teams can use during a race weekend.</li>
            <li>Teams must use at least two different dry tyre compounds during a dry race, adding a strategic element to tyre selection.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tyres are a complex and vital aspect of Formula One racing, requiring careful management and strategic planning to optimize performance and gain a competitive edge.</p>
