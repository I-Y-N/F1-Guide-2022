            <p>Formula One has 10 teams ,Every team in Formula One must run two cars in every 
            session in a Grand Prix weekend, and every team may use up to four drivers in a season
			,teammates drive alongside to earn the highestscore for the team but this sentence is not 
			always right because sometimes drivers have very close scores and that's the reason 
			that drivers push eachother considering that they're in same teame ,sometimes this 
			reason is causing the trouble for the teams and relationship between the teammates</p>

            <p>In the three 90 minutes practices ,drivers try to learn the circuit ,they try to learn 
            each corner and pass them with fastest speed they can ,they also learn how to manage
            ERS and where they're able to open the DRS and practicing to open it as soon as possible because even a 0.1 second could be very valuable .All drivers will be able to use DRS for the practices
			and qualifying .Teams use practices to work on setups and strategy choices for the coming weekend, while the drivers get an opportunity to learn or re-familiarise themselves with the circuit.in the practices teames try to choose best tyre compound for the drivers
            and also they choose the best available carsetup for the race .</p>

            <p>In the qualifying time drivers must record fastest lap they can to get good position 
            for the race . The Saturday qualifying session is split between three separate knockout phases in which the slowest five drivers are steadily eliminated. The positions at the end of the final session determine the starting grid for the Sunday race.
			. qualifying has Three seprate sessions that drivers have 18 minutes in each ,to get laps in,in the first session(Q1) five most
			slowest cars don't get to the next stage and they'll retire form qualifying ,in the second
			session(Q2) Fifteen cars remain compete each other because in this session like the last 
			session five slowest cars will enter to the elimation zone and they won't attend to 
			the last session of qualifying (Note:The tyres that drivers and teames are chosen for 
			this session of qualifying must be use for the sunday starting race)  ,in the third session of the qualifying
			(Q3)10 best drivers try to give best position for the tomorrow's race . Qualifyings are 
			always exciting because the competition is very close even the 0.1 second 
			can change position of the drivers for the race. </p>

            <li class="topics"><h2 id="race-h2" class="race-h2">RACE</h2></li>
			<img class="h2" src="F1-pictures/RACE.jpg" alt="RACE"/>
            <p>The race begins with a warm-up lap, after which the cars are placed on the starting 
			grid in the order they qualified. This lap is often referred to as the formation lap, as
			the cars lap in formation with no overtaking (although a driver who makes a mistake may 
			regain lost ground). The warm-up lap allows drivers to check the condition of the track 
			and their car, gives the tyres a chance to warm up to increase traction, and 
            also gives the pit crews time to clear themselves and their equipment from the grid . Once
			all the cars have  formed on the grid, after the medical car positions itself behind the
			pack, a light system above the track indicates the start of the race: five red lights 
			are illuminated at intervals of one second; they are all then extinguished 
			simultaneously after an unspecified time (typically less than 3 seconds) to signal the 
			start of the race. The start procedure may be abandoned if a driver stalls on the grid, 
			signalled by raising their arm. If this happens, the procedure restarts: a new formation
			lap begins with the offending car removed from the grid. The race may also be restarted 
			in the event of a serious accident or dangerous conditions, with the original start 
			voided. The race may be started from behind the Safety Car if race control feels a 
			racing start would be excessively dangerous, such as extremely heavy rainfall. As of the
			2019 season, there will always be a standing restart. If due to heavy rainfall a start 
			behind the safety car is necessary, then after the track has dried sufficiently, drivers
			will form up for a standing start. There is no formation lap when races start behind the
			Safety Car.</p>

			<img class="h2" src="F1-pictures/SAFTYCAR.jpg" alt="SAFTYCAR"/>
            <p>In the event of an incident that risks the safety of competitors or trackside race marshals, race officials may choose to deploy the safety car. This in effect suspends the race, with drivers following the safety car around the track at its speed in race order, with overtaking not permitted. Cars that have been lapped may, during the safety car period and depending on circumstances permitted by the race director, be allowed to un-lap themselves in order to ensure a smoother restart and to avoid blue flags being 
			immediately thrown upon the resumption of the race with many of the cars in very close 
			proximity to each other. The safety car circulates until the danger is cleared; after it
			comes in, the race restarts with a "rolling start". Pit stops are permitted under the 
			safety car. Since 2000, the main safety car driver has been German ex-racing driver 
			Bernd Mayländer.[66] On the lap in which the safety car returns to the pits, the leading
			car takes over the role of the safety car until the timing line. After crossing this 
			line, drivers are allowed to start racing for track position once more. Mercedes-Benz 
			supplies Mercedes-AMG models to Formula One to use as the safety cars. From 2021 onwards
			, Aston Martin supplies the Vantage to Formula One to use as the safety car, sharing the
			duty with Mercedes-Benz.</p>

				<p>Shown in conjunction with a yellow flag to indicate that the virtual safety car is in use. During this time, the drivers are given minimum sector times that they must stay above. Full course double yellow flag applies. The car's time relative to this set time is measured at each marshalling post (approximately every 50 m), and the difference is referred to as the car's "delta" time. This delta time is reported to the driver, and must remain  positive throughout the VSC period else the driver will be penalised.

The driver is directed to return to the pit and will take no further part in the race. Filipe Massa and Giancarlo Fisichella are the last drivers to be black flagged.

                                <li><b class="ityre">INTERMEDIATE TYRES</b> <b>:</b></li> <p>The intermediates are the most versatile of the rain tires. They can be used on a wet track with no standing water, as well as a drying surface. The compound has been designed to have a wide working range, guaranteeing a wide crossover window both with the slicks and the full wets. but mostely drivers and teams use these tyres for the light rain and unstable weather.
								</p>
								<li><b class="wtyre">WET TYRES</b> <b>:</b></li> <p>The full wet tyres are the most effective solution for heavy rain. These tyres can evacuate 85 litres of water per second per tyre at 300kph. The profile has been designed to increase resistance to aquaplaning, which gives the tyre more grip in heavy rain.</p>

            <p>Energy Recovery Systems, or ERS for short, consist of Motor Generator Units that harness waste heat energy (from the turbocharger) and waste kinetic energy (from the braking system). This energy is then stored and subsequently used to propel the car.These days, Formula 1 cars use two different ERS: the MGU-H, which harvests thermal energy from the car's exhaust, and the MGU-K, which is an evolution of the original KERS(kinetic energy recovery system).</p>

            <p>The Drag Reduction System (DRS) is a controversial driver-controlled device aimed at aiding overtaking and increasing the chances of wheel-to-wheel racing in Formula 1.DRS is primarily an overtaking aid. It was introduced in 2011 to make overtaking easier. It allows drivers to increase straightline speed by dumping rear wing drag through a slot that can be opened when a car is running within one second of the car in front.<br/><br/>
			You can see difference between who has DRS and who doesn't in image below:<br/><br/>
