            <p>Formula One has 10 teams ,Every team in Formula One must run two cars in every 
            session in a Grand Prix weekend, and every team may use up to four drivers in a season
			,teammatesdrive alongside to earn highestscore for the team but this sentence is not 
			always honest because sometimes drivers have very close points and that's the reason 
			that drivers push eachother consider that they're in same teame ,sometimes this reason 
			cuse the trouble for the teams and relationship between the teammates , Anyway</p>

            <p>In the three practices drivers try to learn the circuit ,they try to learn 
            each corner and pass them with fastes speed they can ,they also learn how to manage
            ERS and where they able to open the DRS .All drivers able to use DRS for the practices
			and qualifying .in the practices teames try to choose best tyre compound for the drivers
            and also they choose the best available carsetup for the race .</p>

            <li class="topics"><h2 class="qualifying-h2">QUALIFYING</h2></li>
			<img class="h2" src="F1-pictures/QUALIFYING.jpg" alt="QUALIFYING"/>
            <p>in the qualifying time drivers must record fastes lap they can to give good position 
            for the race. qualifying has Three seprate sessions ,in the first session(Q1) most five 
			slowest cars don't get to the next stage  and they retire form qualifying ,in the second
			session(Q2) Fifteen cars remain compete each other because in this session like the last 
			session five slowest cars entering to the elimation zone and they not gonna attend to 
			the last session of qualifying (Note:The tyres that drivers and teames are chose for 
			this session must be use for the starting race)  ,in the third session of the qualifying
			(Q3)10 best drivers try to give best position for the tomorrow's race . Qulifyings are 
			always ecxiting because the competition is very close ,insofar as even the 0.1 second 
			can change positionof the driver for the race. </p>

            <li class="topics"><h2 class="race-h2">RACE</h2></li>
			<img class="h2" src="F1-pictures/RACE.jpg" alt="RACE"/>
            <p>The race begins with a warm-up lap, after which the cars assemble on the starting 
			grid in the order they qualified. This lap is often referred to as the formation lap, as
			the cars lap in formation with no overtaking (although a driver who makes a mistake may 
			regain lost ground). The warm-up lap allows drivers to check the condition of the track 
			and their car, gives the tyres a chance to warm up to increase traction, and 
            also gives the pit crews time to clear themselves and their equipment from the grid.Once
			all the cars have  formed on the grid, after the medical car positions itself behind the
			pack, a light system above the track indicates the start of the race: five red lights 
			are illuminated at intervals of one second; they are all then extinguished 
			simultaneously after an unspecified time (typically less than 3 seconds) to signal the 
			start of the race. The start procedure may be abandoned if a driver stalls on the grid, 
			signalled by raising their arm. If this happens, the procedure restarts: a new formation
			lap begins with the offending car removed from the grid. The race may also be restarted 
			in the event of a serious accident or dangerous conditions, with the original start 
			voided. The race may be started from behind the Safety Car if race control feels a 
			racing start would be excessively dangerous, such as extremely heavy rainfall. As of the
			2019 season, there will always be a standing restart. If due to heavy rainfall a start 
			behind the safety car is necessary, then after the track has dried sufficiently, drivers
			will form up for a standing start. There is no formation lap when races start behind the
			Safety Car.</p>

            <li class="topics"><h2 class="safty-car-h2">SAFETY CAR</h2></li>
			<img class="h2" src="F1-pictures/SAFTYCAR.jpg" alt="SAFTYCAR"/>
            <p>In the event of an incident that risks the safety of competitors or trackside race 
			marshals, race officials may choose to deploy the safety car. This in effect suspends 
			the race, with drivers following the safety car around the track at its speed in race 
			order, with overtaking not permitted. Cars that have been lapped may, during the safety 
			car period and depending on circumstances permitted by the race director, be allowed to 
			un-lap themselves in order to ensure a smoother restart and to avoid blue flags being 
			immediately thrown upon the resumption of the race with many of the cars in very close 
			proximity to each other. The safety car circulates until the danger is cleared; after it
			comes in, the race restarts with a "rolling start". Pit stops are permitted under the 
			safety car. Since 2000, the main safety car driver has been German ex-racing driver 
			Bernd Mayländer.[66] On the lap in which the safety car returns to the pits, the leading
			car takes over the role of the safety car until the timing line. After crossing this 
			line, drivers are allowed to start racing for track position once more. Mercedes-Benz 
			supplies Mercedes-AMG models to Formula One to use as the safety cars. From 2021 onwards
			, Aston Martin supplies the Vantage to Formula One to use as the safety car, sharing the
			duty with Mercedes-Benz.</p>

				<img src="F1-pictures/VIRTUAL SAFTY CAR.jpg" class="flags" alt="VIRTUAL	SAFETY CAR"/>
				<p>Shown in conjunction with a yellow flag 
				to indicate that the virtual safety car is in use. During this time, the drivers are
				given minimum sector times that they must stay above. Full course double yellow flag
				applies. The car's time relative to this set time is measured at each marshalling 
				post (approximately every 50 m), and the difference is referred to as the car's 
				"delta" time. This delta time is reported to the driver, and must remain  positive 
				throughout the VSC period else the driver will be penalised.</p>

				<li><h3><b class="SafetyCar">SC Board Safety Car (Yellow flag)</b> :</h3></li> 
				<img src="F1-pictures/SC BOARD.jpg" class="flags" alt="SAFETY CAR"/>
				<p>Shown in conjunction with a yellow flag to

				<p>Normal racing conditions apply. This is usually shown following a

				all stations for the lap following the end of a full-course yellow (or safety car). 
				A green flag is also shown at the start of a session.</p>
				<hr>
				<li><h3><b class="blueflag">BLUE FLAG</b> :</h3></li> 
				<img src="F1-pictures/BLUE FLAG.jpg" class="flags" alt="BLUE FLAG"/>
				<p>A blue flag indicates that the driver in front must let faster 
				cars behind them pass because they are being lapped. If the flag is missed 3 times, 
				the driver could be penalised.</p>
				<hr>
				<!--
				<li><h3><b class="yellowflag">YELLOW Flag</b> :</h3></li> <p>Indicates a hazard on or near the track (waved yellows indicate

            <p>Energy Recovery Systems, or ERS for short, consist of Motor Generator Units that
